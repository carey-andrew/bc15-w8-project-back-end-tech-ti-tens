Deployed on https://bc15-w8-project-front-end-tech-ti-tens-mu.vercel.app/

Working on: Loading time or adding a loading screen, Render takes time to spin up so can appear to have frozen, this is an issue that I would like to fix.

I was pleased to learn how to use MVC style back end and apply it to this build
